Helping Hands seeks to serve the less fortunate through grass root efforts of engaged community members.

# User Story
AS A ally,<br>
I WANT to connect with marginalized peoples, <br>
SO THAT I can give back to my community.

# Installation
To install please visit the [Helping Hands](insertgithublinkhere) and look at the uploaded files via GitHub Deployment. You may fork the repository and download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) Additionally, you will need [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express).The details of how to implement these are provided in the [Usage](#Usage) section below.

# Usage   
Please visit our launched application via [this link](insertlink). Below are the tools used to create Helping Hands.


### GraphQL
[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is an open source data query and manipulation for APIs. It is often used as an alternative to RESTful APIs. GraphQL runs on a server (typically served over HTTP) and uses querying, mutations, and resolvers for retrieving data through the database.



### NoSQL/Mongo DB/Mongoose
Helping Hands' database was created using the non-tabular querying language [NoSQL](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained). NoSQL was used with the ODM Mongoose, as well as the Document Oriented Database system [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

### Visual Studio Code
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSC) was used as to create and develeop Local Heroes. VSC is an lightning fast FREE open-source editor designed by [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/) with developers in mind. Visual Studio code allows developers to easily apply the edit-build-debug cycle, resulting in more productivity on your ideas.

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) brings all that you need as a developer, such as: debugging, instant editing results, customization specifically designed for your preference, hundreds of languages, extensions, version control, and more all at your fingertips!
### Node.js

Node.js was used in combination with VSC. Node.js allows the user to interact with the command line interface instead of the window object. You can download Node [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### npm and Express

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) was used in combination with [Express](https://expressjs.com/) to create a backend middleware server. Express is a flexible Node.js application frameworke that provides many features available for both mobile and the web. Please click the referenced information for documentation on npm and Express. Our database was createad using MySQL and our deployment through Heroku. Additional packages include:

### GitHub/Git

In order to make effective changes to the website both [Git](https://gitforwindows.org/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) were used in synchronization to push commits of the latest updated version.

Git is version control system which allows multiple users to make changes to one single repository.

GitHub is a corporation which provides hosting for version control using Git and software development. [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-user-account-settings) provides all needs for setting up your GitHub and answering problem-solving issues you may come across while using GitHub.
